#### Summary
A video essay discussing red pandas and the reasons they should be protected as a species. Red pandas are an endangered species and have been recognized as such by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) since 2008. They are an omnivorous mammal native to the countries of Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, and Nepal, and are about the size of a housecat. With a declining wild population due to deforestation, poaching, and other factors, as well as an aging captive population, red pandas are on a downward trajectory and need the support of conservationists in order to survive. This video seeks to petition the listener to make efforts to help protect such a vulnerable and unique species in its time of need.
